Topics include requirements analysis, analysis and design of static and dynamic view points of architectures and model driven engineering.

## Projetc handeling
Food4U is a mobile application that aims to help post-secondary students. The app presents the opportunity for grocery stores or restaurants to sell perishables, that would normally be thrown out, to the (commonly) financially-unstable student population for a marked-down price. Suppliers list items, which students can then order through the application. Orders are then prepared, and the students are able to go and pick them up.
